# What is PBot?
The Integrative Paleobotany Portal (PBot) is a free online software for fossil plant data management, analysis, and exploration. Core to the PBot mission is providing broad access to paleobotanical research tools and data and to provide an efficient pipeline for data entry that ensures that research products and data are freely available to the general public for the long term. 

The **_PBot Explore_** portal allows anyone to browse and view all public fossil plant data that has been entered into PBot. Some of the most notable data includes fossil specimens and species (or taxa), their descriptions and images, and the location of fossils in time and space.

For registered users, the **_PBot Workbench_** allows users to (1) create novel, dynamic character schemas for describing plant fossils; (2) enter and compare descriptions of specimens for informally and formally named plant taxa; and (3) comment on PBot contents via a community forum to stimulate productive scientific discourse. Data can be entered as private or public, allowing PBot to be used from the start to the finish of a project. All public data can be accessed by anyone using PBot’s Explore feature. 

PBot works with and complements existing databases (iDigBio, the Paleobiology Database, Plant Fossil Names) to enhance utility and accessibility of paleobotanical data, allowing paleobotanists to more easily fulfill NSF (or other funding agency) data management plans.

# Why PBot?
Fossil plants provide the best record of how Earth’s environments have changed through time. However, plant fossils present unique challenges that previously made this record inaccessible for large scale studies of Earth History. Plant organs (e.g., leaves, wood, fruits, seeds) are rarely preserved attached to each other, and it can be difficult to associate different organs as part of the same plant and assign formal taxonomic names to the isolated organs. No other major paleontological databases can accommodate the informal names that are commonly used for isolated plant organs, and we lacked the necessary tools to coordinate such fossil plant data across institutions, researchers, time periods, and geography. Enter PBot!

# How was PBot designed?
PBot development began in 2021, with funding from NSF EarthCube Award [#2026961](www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2026961&HistoricalAwards=false). The PBot development team committed to creating a system that is “of the community, by the community, and for the community,” and feedback from the international paleobotanical community was incorporated during every step of the development process.

PBot utilizes a graph database. **Additional text from Andrew about why this is amazing and what it allows us to do.**
