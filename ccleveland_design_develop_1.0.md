PBOT Modules (modules are datatables plus function)
1.	MyWorkbench (Can we open two #.#. level modules in separate windows for side-by-side comparison of two morphotypes or a leaf and a fruit etc.?)
1.1.	Monocots (reuse a set of Dicot submodules and add new submodules as appropriate but plug and play functionality retained)
1.2.	Ferns (reuse a set of Dicot submodules and add new submodules as appropriate but plug and play functionality retained)
1.3.	Pollen (reuse a set of Dicot submodules and add new submodules as appropriate but plug and play functionality retained)
1.4.	Etc. (reuse a set of Dicot submodules and add new submodules as appropriate but plug and play functionality retained)
1.5.	Dicots
(This modular format assumes two columns of different fixed widths. Each submodule must fit into either of the columns, preferable so that the total lengths of each column are similar AND that things people may want to see side-by-side are in separate columns—like images and leaf trait identification. A user can choose to select modules to view while the others are hidden for work efficiency. The hidden submodules won’t appear and the selected submodules will “slide” up to compact the visible workspace. The order in each column cannot be changed BUT each column can be scrolled independently so a user can line up two sections of interest. It should be possible to zoom in or zoom out to some degree, to see text, for those of us with bad eyes. Also, it should be possible to open images in a separate window that can be zoomed at very high levels. UNLESS it is just as computationally/coding efficient to allow users to open each submodule as a separate window and move around their screen as they like? ALSO see PID notes about making any published data a

Build on multiple levels of modularity in workbench
•	Modules allow for plug and play—adding in new modules with pre-existing built in interoperability with all moving parts both external and internal to interface

?	Better for modules to point to coding for basic functional integration (fixed for all) or include separately within each module (flexible)?
?	Where draw line between fixed and flexible?


Additional considerations

?	Identify and define roles for staffing—how impacts design
?	Create YouTube tutorials for each of the primary modules (Database, Workbench, Community Forum, Outreach
